to many existing scripts. these additions extend support for written languages of north america china india other asian countries and africa. see the link above for full details. most of the new emoji characters derive from characters in long-standing and widespread use in wingdings and webdings fonts. major enhancements were made to the indic script properties. new property values were added to enable a more algorithmic approach to rendering indic scripts. these include properties for joining behavior new classes for numbers and a further division of the syllabic categories of viramas and rephas. with these enhancements the default rendering for newly added indic scripts can be significantly improved. unicode character properties were extended to the new characters. the old characters have enhancements to script and alphabetic properties and casing and line-breaking behavior. there were also nearly 3,000 new cantonese pronunciation entries as well as new or clarified stability policies for promoting interoperable implementations. two other important unicode specifications are maintained in synchrony with the unicode standard and have updates for version 7.0. these will be

for encoding spec 06 june 2014 from internationalization activity blog w3cxmlcore a last call working draft of encodinghas been published. while encodings have been defined to some extent implementations have not always implemented them in the same way have not always used the same labels and often differ in dealing with undefined and former proprietary areas of encodings. this specification attempts to fill those gaps so that new implementations do not have to reverse engineer encoding implementations of the market leaders and existing implementations can converge. the body of this spec is an exact copy of the whatwg version as of the date of its publication intended to provide a stable reference for other specifications. we are hoping for people to review the specification and send comments about any technical areas that need attention see the status section for details please send comments by 1 july 2014. one more week to feisgiltt learn about and
