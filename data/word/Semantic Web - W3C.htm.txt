classic web of documents w3c is helping to build a technology stack to support a web of data the sort of data you find in databases. the ultimate goal of the web of data is to enable computers to do more useful work and to develop systems that can support trusted interactions over the network. the term semantic web refers to w3c s vision of the web of linked data. semantic web technologies enable people to create data stores on the web build vocabularies and write rules for handling data. linked data are empowered by technologies such as rdf sparql owl and skos. linked data the semantic web is a web of data of dates and titles and part numbers and chemical properties and any other data one might conceive of. rdf provides the foundation for publishing and linking your data. various technologies allow you to embed data in documents rdfa grddl or expose what you have in sql databases or make it available as rdf files. vocabularies at times it may be important or valuable to organize data. using owl to build vocabularies or ontologies and skos for designing knowledge organization systems it is possible to enrich data with additional meaning which allows more people and more machines to do more with the data. query query languages go hand-in-hand with databases. if the semantic web is viewed as a global database then it is easy to understand why one would need a query language for that data. sparql is the query language for the semantic web. inference near the top of the semantic web stack one finds inference reasoning over data through rules. w3c work on rules primarily through rif and owl is focused on translating between rule languages and exchanging rules among different systems. vertical applications w3c is working with different industries for example in health care and life sciences egovernment and energy to improve collaboration research and development and innovation adoption through semantic web technology. for instance by aiding decision-making in clinical research semantic web technologies will bridge many forms of biological and medical information across institutions. news announcing the unicode standard version 7.0 17 june 2014 from internationalization activity blog w3csemanticweb version 7.0 of the unicode standardis now available adding 2,834 new characters. this latest version adds the new currency symbols for the russian ruble and azerbaijani manat approximately 250 emoji pictographic symbols many other symbols and 23 new lesser-used and historic scripts as well as character additions to many existing scripts. these additions extend support for written languages of north america china india other asian countries and africa. see the link above for full details. most of the new emoji characters derive from characters in long-standing and widespread use in wingdings and webdings fonts. major enhancements were made to the indic script properties. new property values were added to enable a more algorithmic approach to rendering indic scripts. these include properties for joining behavior new classes for numbers and a further division of the syllabic categories of viramas and rephas. with these enhancements the default rendering for newly added indic scripts can be significantly improved. unicode character properties were extended to the new characters. the old characters have enhancements to script and alphabetic properties and casing and line-breaking behavior. there were also nearly 3,000 new cantonese pronunciation entries as well as new or clarified stability policies for promoting interoperable implementations. two other important unicode specifications are maintained in synchrony with the unicode standard and have updates for version 7.0. these will be released at the same time uts 10 unicode collation algorithm the standard for sorting unicode text uts 46 unicode idna compatibility processing for processing of non-ascii urls idns workshop report summary of the ld4lt group kickoff lider roadmapping workshop 11 june 2014 from internationalization activity blog w3csemanticweb the lider project has published a report on the first linked data for language technology event which was held 21st march in alignment with the european data forum in athens. read the report. industry stakeholders from many areas localization publishing language technology applications etc. and key researchers from linked data and language technology discussed promises and challenges around linguistic linked data. the report summarizes all presentations and includes an initial list of use cases and requirements for linguistic linked data. this and the overall outcome of the event will feed into work of the ld4lt group see especially the ld4lt latest draft version of use cases and the field of multilingual linked data in general. the ld4lt group is part of the multilingualweb community learn more about related projects. last call draft published for encoding spec 06 june 2014 from internationalization activity blog w3csemanticweb a last call working draft of encodinghas been published. while encodings have been defined to some extent implementations have not always implemented them in the same way have not always used the same labels and often differ in dealing with undefined and former proprietary areas of encodings. this specification attempts to fill those gaps so that new implementations do not have to reverse engineer encoding implementations of the market leaders and existing implementations can converge. the body of this spec is an exact copy of the whatwg version as of the date of its publication intended to provide a stable reference for other specifications. we are hoping for people to review the specification and send comments about any technical areas that need attention see the status section for details please send comments by 1 july 2014. one more week to feisgiltt learn about and contribute to the future of web and
